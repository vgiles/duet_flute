# duet for flute and computer (2011)
## Vincent Giles

duet for flute and computer (patch file); created using Pure Data (pd-extended) in 2011. 

This is the computer performance patch for my composition Duet for Flute and Computer, available through [Wirripang](http://australiancomposers.com.au/authors/vincent-giles/duet-score-and-part)

Requires [Pure Data Extended (pd-extended)](https://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended), also seems to work with modern [purr-data](https://puredata.info/downloads/purr-data) versions, but please note this is not tested in the wild. Only tested on macOS/OSX from 10.8 to 10.12.

NB: There is a soundfile load request embedded in the patch; "timelapse.wav", this is for testing purposes only and the lack of audio file will _not_ affect the performance of the patch.
